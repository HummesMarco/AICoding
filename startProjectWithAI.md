Prompt for a Coding Agent or AI Assistant:

I am starting a new software project. Please help me create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) and a highly granular implementation task list, following these best practices:

1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Draft a clear, concise PRD for my project.
Include:
App overview and description
Scope (what’s in/out for MVP)
Target audience and user needs
Key features (with short, actionable bullet points)
Success metrics
Assumptions and risks
Functionality review (main user workflows)
Technical alignment (stack, architecture, relevant docs)
Open topics (list any info needed from me to complete the PRD)
Use modern, professional language and structure.
Make sure the PRD is actionable and ready for review by stakeholders or developers.
2. Implementation Task List
Break down the PRD into a step-by-step, best-practice implementation checklist.
For each area (backend, frontend, integration, testing, devops, etc.), create atomic, actionable subtasks.
For backend, include:
Data model design (with fields)
Migrations
API endpoint design (CRUD for each entity)
Validation (business rules, constraints)
OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
Unit and integration tests
Edge case handling
CI/CD and deployment prep
For frontend, include:
UI/UX design (wireframes, layout, theming)
Component breakdown
State management
API integration
Validation and error handling
Testing (unit, integration, manual)
For each subtask, be as specific as possible (e.g., “Implement REST API endpoint: Create Material” instead of just “Material API”).
Include a status summary and next steps at the end.
3. Granularity & Clarity
Ensure every task is atomic and can be picked up by a developer or coding agent without ambiguity.
Use checklists and clear section headers.
Make sure the PRD and task list are always in sync and reference each other where needed.
My project is:

Deliverables:

A markdown PRD file
A markdown implementation task list file, broken down as above
Example:
(You may refer to the structure and detail level in the PRD and implementation-task-list.md from my previous project.)
